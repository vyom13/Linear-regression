# Logistic Regression
**Logistic Regression**  
Write your own python script for classification using logistic regression.  You mayrefer to relevant code posted on the UNCC Canvas page for our class.  Performbinary  classification  analysis  of  the  virginica  and  versicolor  flowers  using  petallength  and  petal  width  in  the  iris  data  set  using  your  own  logistic  regressionfunction.   Use  leave-one-out  cross  validation  and  get  the  average  error  rate,  i.e.you will perform logistic regression 100 times total with each of the 100 flowersused once for testing.  

Compare classification results you have obtained using ANN with the results youhave obtained using logistic regression.
